title: MN UNITED FC V CLUB LÉON FC
description: >-
  MN United FC recently sold one of their most beloved players, Miguel Ibarra,
  to Club Léon FC. But on July 18th, 2015 he came back to the National Sports
  Center Stadium in Blaine, MN for one more friendly match where he played
  half of the game on each team. I was fortunate enough to be able to work
  with MN United to make commemorative posters and t-shirts for the event.
