  Client: Uncle John’s Bathroom Reader</br></br>

  Uncle John’s asked me to do cover illustrations for a series of fun placemat
  activity books for kids. The books are intended to give the kids something to
  do while they are waiting for their moms to make them food so they don’t drive
  them insane.
