title: Sam Schuna | ARTCRANK 2015
description: >-
  ARTCRANK is a pop-up poster party for bike people, and it all started right
  here in Minneapolis in 2007. Since its debut, the show has blown up in
  various cities across the nation and even abroad, so I was honored to be
  among the artists participating in this year's local event.
