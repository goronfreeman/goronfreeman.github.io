title: END TABLE
description: >-
  This end table was my half of a laborious collaboration with friend and fellow
  designer <a href="http://dippedinacid.com/">Lucas Richards</a>, founder of
  Mousesaw. We each designed and screenprinted the sides and inside drawers of
  two identical wooden endtables with our own take on an apocalyptic city scene.
  The final product involved over 100 separate layers and over 6 months of work.
