title: IM ATELIER
description: >-
  Im Atelier was a group design project I completed while studying abroad at
  HAWK in Hildesheim, Germany. Everyone in the class brainstormed visual
  concepts for a boxed set of books from various German authors and poets, and
  in the end my design was blended together with another studentâ€™s to make the
  final product.
