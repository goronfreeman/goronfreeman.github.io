title: Sam Schuna | TOUGH LUCK PLAYING CARDS
description: >-
  Every summer our extended family gets together to spend a week playing cards
  and eating junk food in the secluded woods of northern Minnesota.
  I look forward to this week all year long. I started this project in my
  off-time in hopes of giving my family a deck of cards with a little more
  flavor to play with during that time, and was fortunate enough to
  collaborate with <a href="http://legendsplayingcards.com/">Legends Playing Card Co.</a>
  to get them professionally printed.
